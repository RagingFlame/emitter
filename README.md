When you use a programming language for some time, overtime, you start to notice certain patterns that keep re-occuring. If you are curious enough you will deeper and try to make sense of everything.

Over my years of using JavaScript I have notice a pattern that is obvious but doesn't get pointed out enough. JavaScript is an event-driven programming language. A lot of effort has been put into explaining the asyncronomity of the language and its heavy use of prototypal inheritance but it event-driven nature is not explained in a way that given me that 'Aha' moment.

The early Days

Then Ajax and jQuery came along and my life was never the same again. jQuery healed the pain of writing cross-browser compatible code, while Ajax broaght sexy back to JavaScript and the web. 

The Present Day
The world revolves around time and events, actions and reactions. JavaScript makes it painless to switch the way we see the natural way to
