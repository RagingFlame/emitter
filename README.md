When you use a programming overtime, you start to notice certain patterns that keep recurring. I write a lot of JavaScript and for me JavaScript events have really resonated with me.

A bit of history
When I started using JavaScript about 6 years ago, I used events mainly for interacting with DOM objects. Some my most used DOM event handlers were: `onLoad`, `onClick`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`, `onSubmit`. JavaScript was merely a means to an end, it didn't have any sex appeal.

When you use a programming language for some time, overtime, you start to notice certain patterns that keep re-occuring. If you are curious enough you will deeper and try to make sense of everything.

Over my years of using JavaScript I have noticed a pattern that is obvious but doesn't get pointed out enough. JavaScript is an event-driven programming language. A lot of effort has been put into explaining the async nature of the language and its prototypal inheritance but its event-driven nature has not been explained in a way that has given me that 'Aha' moment.

### The early Days
When I started using JavaScript about 6 years ago it was mostly for UI interactions and form validation. In those days a heavy decoration of JavaScript in your HTML markup was not an uncommon sight.

JavaScript events where mainly used for interacting with DOM objects. Some of the commonly used DOM event handlers were: `onLoad`, `onClick`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onMouseOver`, `onMouseOut`, `onSubmit`. JavaScript was merely a means to an end, it didn't have any sex appeal.

The clumsy code days got better when I moved on to something that the JS community was preaching at the time, unobtrusive JavaScript. Unobtrusive JavaScript meant seperating your JavaScript code from the HTML and using the DOM to access HTML elements. The result was cleaner and more debuggable code, life was getting better.

Then Ajax and jQuery came along and my life was never the same again. jQuery healed the pain of writing cross-browser compatible code, while Ajax broaght sexy back to JavaScript and the web. 

### One language to rule them all!
While its detractors were sharing coffee break jokes about its quirks and imperfections, JavaScript was silently improving and building its empire. Browser interprers got faster, noobs learnt about the good parts and Node.js emerged.
